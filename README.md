# Hi, I'm Reece White 👋🗿

I’m a Software Engineer with 5 years of experience building full-stack applications. I specialize in scalable systems, having worked extensively with Ruby on Rails, Kotlin, React, Next.js and Cloud Infrastructure.

I enjoy digging into complex backend topics, deploying and managing infrastructure to solve real-world problems, and building clean, user-focused frontends.
